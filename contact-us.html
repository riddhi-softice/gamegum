                    <h2>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) Concerns</h2>
                    <p>We own the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) to a large number of the games on game sites. For certain games, we have requested and obtained licenses from the known copyright holders. However, for some games, we could not find any copyright information, or due to general use on the internet, this information can no longer be obtained.</p>
                    <p>Some games may be used under special conditions, considering a number of prerequisite constraints. These prerequisite constraints are, as far as we could determine, met by Game.</p>
                    <p>We do not change anything in the source code of the games. For example, credit holders, brand names, or references to websites remain unchanged. If any copyright or other IPR that you may have is possibly being infringed by/on game sites, please inform us immediately by providing the following information:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The electronic or physical signature of the owner of the IPR or the person authorized to act on the owner's behalf.</li>
                        <li>A description of the IP Right that has been infringed, and a description of the infringing activity.</li>
                        <li>The location where the unauthorized copy of the copyrighted work exists (for example, the URL of the Game website where it is posted, or the name of the book in which it has been published, or, in the case of a registered brand name, an excerpt of such register evidencing the registry).</li>
                        <li>A copy of a license in which you are granted the right to use and to protect such IPR (if you are not the owner of the IPR).</li>
                        <li>The identification of the URL or other specific location on this site where the material that you claim is infringing is located; this information must be specific enough to enable us to locate such material.</li>
                        <li>Your name and full contact details.</li>
                        <li>A statement by you that you have a sincere and honest belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Please send the above details to <a href="mailto:contact@game.com">contact@game.com</a>. We will review your submission and take action as soon as possible. We will reply to your query within 7 days.</p>
