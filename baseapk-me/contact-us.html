                                <p>Some games may be used under special conditions, considering a number of prerequisite constraints. These prerequisite constraints are, as far as we could determine, met by Game.</p>
                                <p>We do not change anything in the source code of the games. For example, credit holders, brand names, or references to websites remain unchanged. If any copyright or other IPR that you may have is possibly being infringed by/on game sites, please inform us immediately by providing the following information:</p>
